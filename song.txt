You would use your songs to say the words you couldn't say
And every word you said was about you and me
I loved, everything you wrote and when you would sing
I felt that my heart was falling
You're all that I want
We fuck so hard, it left me faded
For all you are
There is no other love, it's only yours
You're all that I want, all the love
